        is a cooperative project located at the northwest end of Berlin’s Tempelhofer Feld, right by the Ringbahn. It brings together living, working, and public spaces in a way that’s open and accessible to everyone. The idea is to create a welcoming place where people from all walks of life can connect, share experiences, and enjoy a lively, community-driven environment in the heart of the city.

        Location and Accessibility
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        Located at the northwest end of Tempelhofer Feld in Berlin, directly by the Ringbahn, the new cooperative building "PLATEAU" aims to blend openness, versatility, and accessibility, positioning itself as an inclusive architectural space. The project integrates living, working, and urban life, creating a public space for everyone. With easy access via a bridge to the Ringbahn and two public stairways, the site serves as a welcoming hub for social interaction. The shared rooftop space fosters a sense of community, making "PLATEAU" a vibrant urban landmark.

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        The flexible space design meets various needs. The ground floor features a supermarket, its management and storage areas, and parking for residents and businesses. The first floor hosts a lively public area with a food court, fitness rooms, a laundromat, self-help workshop, hair salon, and artist studios. A multifunctional bistro can serve as a meeting, event, or workshop space, with an outdoor area hosting local markets and events. The residential spaces on the 2nd and 3rd floors offer 4 to 5-room as well as 2 room apartments, while a smaller building provides shared accommodations with temporary rental rooms.

        At PLATEAU, sustainability is more than just a feature – it's part of the everyday experience. The building follows the 2226 concept, a smart energy strategy based on simple yet effective principles: the building maintains comfortable indoor temperatures (between 22°C and 26°C) without traditional heating or cooling systems. This works thanks to thick, highly insulating walls that store warmth and keep out the cold.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        Instead of radiators or air conditioners, the heat that people, lights, and devices naturally give off is enough to keep comfortable temperatures. Fresh air comes through windows that are controlled by a smart system – but can also be opened and closed manually whenever needed. The long shape of the building also allows for great cross-ventilation, especially in the warmer months.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        On the roof, there’s a 350 m² photovoltaic system that produces around 280,000 to 350,000 kWh of electricity each year – enough to cover the building’s entire energy needs. During the day, most of the power goes to the supermarket and commercial areas (like fridges and ventilation systems). Extra electricity is stored in batteries and helps power heat pumps, which reuse the supermarket’s waste heat to provide hot water for the apartments.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        For warm days, the building’s smart design helps keep things cool. Thick walls, shaded outdoor walkways, and smart window positioning reduce overheating – without the need for air conditioning. Altogether, this makes PLATEAU energy-efficient and climate-friendly, with a strong focus on using natural resources wisely and creating minimal waste.

    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        PLATEAU is built with long-lasting, natural materials that support its energy-saving goals. The exterior walls are made from 49 cm thick perforated clay bricks (Poroton), filled with natural perlite insulation. On top of that sits a layer of weather-resistant brick cladding. This three-part wall system insulates well, stores heat, and hardly needs any maintenance – perfect for long-term durability.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        In terms of the building’s structure, the ground and first floors are built from reinforced concrete for stability, while the upper residential floors use solid timber walls. This mix keeps the structure strong but reduces the environmental footprint where possible.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        To save time and money during construction, key elements like bathrooms and ceiling slabs are prefabricated in workshops and then brought to the site – kind of like putting together high-quality building blocks. Only the foundation and parts of the public Plateau level are poured on-site.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        Another smart feature is the use of permeable paving around the building. Instead of sealing the ground with concrete, rainwater can seep through the surfaces, reducing water buildup and naturally replenishing the groundwater.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold">
        All in all, PLATEAU combines smart construction methods, environmentally conscious materials, and a thoughtful design approach to keep costs down, reduce environmental impact, and support long-term sustainability.
